# uber-end-to-end-data-Pipeline-with-GCP
This project analyzes Uber trip data using cloud tools. The goal is to build an ETL data pipeline with Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and visualize insights in Looker Studio. We use Python, Compute Engine, Mage for pipeline orchestration, BigQuery for data storage and querying, and Looker Studio for visualization.
